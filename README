# AutoCLI Python Library

A tiny utility library to provide higher level usage mechanisms for
Python's argparse.


## Object Parsing

Initially, this supports parsing an object that is declared by example.
AutoCLI automatically builds an argparse parser to parse an instance
of an object from a set of flags, such as those specified on the command
line.
